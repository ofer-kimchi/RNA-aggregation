Code to accompany Kimchi et al. 2022

computational_enumeration.py exactly calculates the partition functions for a given value of F_b using the dynamic programming algorithm detailed in the paper. 

figures_for_paper_github.py loads the calculated partition functions and makes the plots shown in the paper.

ways_to_connect_m/ gives stored results necessary to correct the partition functions to calculate only connected clusters
