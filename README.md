Code to accompany Kimchi et al. 2022

computational_enumeration.py exactly calculates the partition functions for a given value of F_b using the dynamic programming algorithm detailed in the paper. Because of file upload size limits, the results themselves cannot be uploaded directly but they can be regenerated by running this code, or can be shared directly if you reach out.

figures_for_paper_github.py loads the calculated partition functions and makes the plots shown in the paper.

ways_to_connect_m/ gives stored results necessary to correct the partition functions to calculate only connected clusters

Any questions or correspondence can be addressed to okimchi@princeton.edu.
